## 👨🏻‍💻 Issues

The best way to contribute to our projects is to apply to the issues <a href="https://github.com/PayStell/paystell-website/issues" target="_blank">here</a> .


---

## 1️⃣ Fork the Repository

- Click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner to create a copy of the repository under your account.

---

## 2️⃣ Clone the Fork

- Clone the forked repository to your local machine by running the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPOSITORY_NAME.git
   ```

- Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `REPOSITORY_NAME` with your GitHub username and the repository name.

---

## 3️⃣ Create a new branch or use the main branch

- Create a branch name based on the type of change (e.g., `feat/name-related-issue`, `docs/name-related-issue`).

   ```bash
   git checkout -b branch-name
   ```

   > Example: `docs/update-readme` or `fix/bottom-bug`.

---

## 4️⃣ Make Changes and Write Atomic Commits

- Make changes in your local repository
- Follow **atomic commit principles**:

   - Each commit should address a single, logical change.
   - Avoid bundling unrelated changes in a single commit. In case you want to add additional items, please ask the mainteiners first.
   - Write clear and descriptive commit messages using the format:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "[type] description"
   ```

   > Types and when to use them:

   - `[feat]` A new feature
   - `[fix]` A bug fix
   - `[docs]` Documentation changes
   - `[style]` Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (formatting, etc.)
   - `[refactor]` Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
   - `[perf]` Changes that improve performance
   - `[test]` Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
   - `[build]` Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
   - `[ci]` Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
   - `[chore]` Maintenance changes that do not fall into any of the other categories

---

## 5️⃣ Run the Project Locally

- Ensure the project runs correctly after making your changes.
- Follow the project-specific setup instructions to test your changes locally.

---

## 6️⃣ Push Your Changes

- Push your changes to your forked repository:

   ```bash
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```
   > - Replace `your-branch-name` with the name of your branch.
---

## 7️⃣ Create a Pull Request (PR)

- Navigate to your forked repository on GitHub.
- Click **New Pull Request** and select your branch to merge into the `main` of the original repository.

---

## 📝 Additional Notes

- Make sure your code adheres to the repository’s coding standards.
- Respect the project maintainers' feedback and requested changes.
